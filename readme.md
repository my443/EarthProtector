# EarthProtector

Your hands feel sweaty as you prepare for the next wave of assailants. 

Your job is to protect the Earth from invasion by aliens. After peace talks failed, countries built earth-based laser launchers to save Earth from the expected onslaught. 

You have one piece of sky to protect. Your success or failure could change humanity's future. 

We call people who have risen to the call **Earth Protectors**.



## Game Play
Use the arrow keys or joystick to aim your laser-missiles: Space-bar or the A button on the joystick fires. 

Your missile-launcher has some protection built in, but if you are hit directly three times your launcher will be destroyed. Earth Protectors refer to each direct hit as 'losing a life.'

## Code Details
This game is a foray into game programming in C#.
